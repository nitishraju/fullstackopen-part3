## Fullstack Open Solutions

The [Fullstack Open 2020 course](https://fullstackopen.com/en/ "Fullstack Open 2020") is an in-depth introduction to modern web applications built with JavaScript.

The primary focus is on building applications with ReactJS that utilize REST APIs built with Node.js. 

The course covers development, testing, configuration and environment management, along with the usage of MongoDB to store application data.
